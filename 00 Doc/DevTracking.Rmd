```

Plot 1 and 2: 
- High percentage of male on the ship is in age range 20 to 40.
- For males, most fares are below 100. While for females, the percentage of 100+ fares are higher. However, the most expensive fares (at 500+) belong to males.
- Females are generally below 60 years of age, in contrast to males (the eldest male is at 80).


```{r}
# source("../02 Visualizations/Titanic_plot3.R"", echo = TRUE)
```

Plot 3:
- High percentage of females survived, the opposite for males.


```{r}
# source("../02 Visualizations/Titanic_plot4.R"", echo = TRUE)
```

Plot 4:
- For PCLASS 1 and 2, most females survived, which is different from PCLASS 3.


```{r}
# source("../02 Visualizations/Titanic_plot5.R"", echo = TRUE)
```

Plot 5:
- All children (less than 10 years of age) in PCLASS 1 and 2 survived except one. On the contrary, only about half of children in PCLASS 3 survived.
